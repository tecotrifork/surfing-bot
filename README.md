### Programmatic Usage

```python
from gpt import SurfingConditionsBot

bot = SurfingConditionsBot()

# Get surfing conditions for a specific city

response = bot.chat_with_user("What are the surfing conditions in Santa Monica?")
print(response)
```

### Example Script

Run the example script to see various queries in action:

```bash
python example_usage.py
```

## How It Works

1. **City Geocoding**: Uses OpenMeteo's geocoding API to convert city names to coordinates
2. **Weather Data Fetching**: Retrieves marine weather data including:
   - Wave height and direction
   - Wave period
   - Swell height, direction, and period
   - Date-range specific forecasts
3. **Surf Quality Analysis**: Calculates a quality score based on:
   - Optimal wave height (1-3 meters)
   - Wave period (8-15 seconds ideal)
   - Swell conditions
4. **Safety Assessment**: Evaluates conditions based on user experience:
   - **Beginner**: Prioritizes waves ‚â§1.5m with gentle conditions
   - **Intermediate**: Suitable for waves up to 3-4m
   - **Advanced**: Can handle larger waves up to 6-8m
5. **Skill-Level Comparison**: Ranks multiple cities based on:
   - User experience level detection
   - Safety-adjusted scoring
   - Personalized recommendations
6. **Smart Recommendations**: Provides advice based on conditions and skill level

## Surf Quality Scoring

The bot uses a sophisticated scoring system (0-10) based on:

- **Wave Height**: 1-3m is optimal for most surfers
- **Wave Period**: 8-15 seconds provides the best ride quality
- **Swell Height**: 1-2.5m creates good surfable waves
- **Swell Period**: 10-16 seconds indicates clean, organized swell

## API Endpoints Used

- **OpenMeteo Geocoding API**: For city-to-coordinates conversion
- **OpenMeteo Marine API**: For wave and swell data
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For natural language processing and conversation

## Example Output

```
üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Surfing Conditions for San Diego** üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
